# Case Study: Creative AI - Brand-Compliant Image Generation Platform

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Global Pharmaceutical Marketing Teams (Indegene)
**Industry:** Pharmaceutical / Creative Services
**Solution:** Multi-Model AI Image & Character Generation
**Results:** 95% faster creative production, 80% cost reduction, unlimited brand variations

---

## The Challenge

Pharmaceutical brands faced creative production bottlenecks:
- **Slow turnaround:** 2-4 weeks for custom imagery
- **High costs:** $2,000-$5,000 per image from agencies
- **Limited variations:** Expensive to test multiple creative concepts
- **Brand inconsistency:** Stock photos don't match brand guidelines
- **Character continuity:** Impossible to reuse same people across campaigns
- **Rights management:** Licensing fees and usage restrictions
- **Revision cycles:** Weeks to incorporate feedback

Traditional stock photography lacked brand specificity, and custom photoshoots were prohibitively expensive for most campaigns.

## Key Innovation: Consistent Character Generation

**Challenge:** Traditional AI image generators can't create the same person twice.

**Solution:** RenderNet-powered character library

**How it works:**
1. **Character Creation:** Specify attributes (age, gender, ethnicity, hair, body type)
2. **Base Model Generation:** AI creates consistent base character
3. **Scene Variations:** Place character in different poses, settings, outfits
4. **Library Management:** Save and reuse across campaigns
5. **Team Sharing:** Entire marketing team accesses same characters

**Result:** Cohesive brand storytelling with recognizable "brand ambassadors"

**Example Use Case:**
- Create Dr. Sarah (40s, professional, diverse ethnicity)
- Use Dr. Sarah across 20 different campaign materials
- Maintain visual continuity for brand recognition
- No model fees, unlimited usage rights
