# Case Study: AI-Powered Medical Content Transcreation & Video Generation

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Global Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Companies (Indegene)
**Industry:** Life Sciences / Medical Communications
**Solution:** Multi-Modal AI Platform for Storyboard & Video Creation
**Results:** 90% faster video production, 75% cost reduction, 10x content localization scale

---

## The Challenge

Medical education and marketing teams faced video production barriers:
- **Slow production:** 6-8 weeks to create a single medical education video
- **High costs:** $20,000-$50,000 per video for professional production
- **Limited localization:** Only top 3 languages economically viable
- **Complex content:** Medical/scientific concepts hard to visualize
- **Document conversion:** Clinical documents don't translate to video scripts
- **Storyboard bottleneck:** Manual storyboarding took weeks
- **Avatar limitations:** Stock video actors lacked medical credibility
- **Scalability:** Impossible to create personalized videos at scale

Traditional video production required agencies, actors, studios, and multiple revision cycles—making it slow and expensive.

## Key Innovation: Document-to-Video Pipeline

### Step 1: Document Analysis
- Upload medical PDF, PowerPoint, or Word document
- AI extracts key concepts, data points, and narrative structure
- Identifies optimal scene breaks and visual opportunities

### Step 2: Storyboard Generation
- GPT-4 creates scene-by-scene script
- Adds voiceover narration for each scene
- Suggests visual elements (diagrams, animations, avatars)
- Maintains medical accuracy by citing source document

### Step 3: Visual Creation
- DALL-E-3 or Stable Diffusion generates custom scene images
- Pexels provides supplemental stock footage
- Predis.ai suggests social media adaptations

### Step 4: Video Assembly
