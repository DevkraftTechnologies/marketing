# Case Study: AI-Powered HR Assistant - Intelligent Employee Support

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Enterprise HR Departments (Multiple Sectors)
**Industry:** Human Resources / Enterprise Software
**Solution:** Multi-Modal AI HR Chatbot with RAG
**Results:** 85% reduction in HR ticket volume, 24/7 employee support, 90% satisfaction rate

---

## The Challenge

HR departments were overwhelmed with repetitive employee queries:
- **High ticket volume:** 500+ queries per week for 1,000 employees
- **Response delays:** 24-48 hour average response time
- **Document chaos:** Policies scattered across drives and intranet
- **Onboarding burden:** New hires needed constant hand-holding
- **Verification bottlenecks:** Manual document verification took days
- **Limited hours:** HR team only available during business hours
- **Knowledge silos:** Expertise trapped in individual HR professionals
- **Compliance risk:** Inconsistent policy interpretation

Traditional HR portals and FAQ systems failed because employees needed conversational, contextual answers—not static documentation.
