**Solution:** AI-Powered Content Generation with Brand Compliance
**Results:** 10x content production speed, 95% compliance rate, $2M annual savings

## The Challenge

Pharmaceutical marketing teams struggled with content creation bottlenecks:
- **Regulatory complexity:** Every piece requires medical-legal review
- **Slow turnaround:** 2-3 weeks for a single email campaign
- **Brand consistency:** 200+ products across 50+ markets

- **High production costs:** $5,000-$10,000 per content piece

Traditional content agencies couldn't scale with the volume demands, and manual processes created quality inconsistencies.
