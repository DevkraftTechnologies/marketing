## OVERVIEW

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Industry Context:** Tire warranty claims processing traditionally requires 2-3 days of manual inspection and subjective decision-making, with 30% inconsistency rate across adjusters.

**Client:** Zaffco (Tire Warranty Processing, 200+ employees, processing 50,000+ claims annually)

**Challenge:** Manual tire warranty claim processing was slow, inconsistent, and couldn't scale to meet growing demand from retail partners.

**Solution:** AI-powered automation system combining computer vision (YOLOv8), multi-modal AI analysis (OpenAI GPT-5 Vision), and intelligent business rules engine.

**Results:**
• 93% reduction in processing time (2 days → 30 seconds average)
• 95% decision accuracy with automated defect detection
• $2M annual cost savings through automation and reduced disputes
• 100x scalability - handles 100+ concurrent claims vs. 5-10 manual
• 400% first-year ROI with 7-week deployment timeline

**Key Technology:** FastAPI, YOLOv8, OpenAI GPT-5 Vision, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS

**Timeline:** 7 weeks from kickoff to production deployment

**Investment:** Mid-range enterprise AI implementation ($150K-$200K)

**Key Innovation:** Hybrid AI approach combining specialized computer vision for defect detection with general-purpose AI for contextual rule evaluation and decision reasoning.

### Meet Zaffco

**Who They Are**

Zaffco is a tire warranty claims processing company founded in 2018, specializing in third-party warranty administration for tire manufacturers and retailers. With 200+ employees across North America, they process warranty claims for major tire brands and serve a network of 5,000+ retail partners. Their core service is evaluating tire defects and determining warranty coverage for manufacturers.

**Scale & Context**

The company processes 50,000+ warranty claims annually, with each claim involving multiple tire images, purchase documentation, and complex brand-specific warranty rules. With claims adjusters spending 60% of their time on routine claim analysis, processing bottlenecks were limiting growth. Tire manufacturers and retailers demand 24-48 hour turnaround times, but manual processing took 2-3 days per claim. Inconsistent decisions across adjusters led to disputes and appeals, costing $500K annually in rework.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Key Insights: What Enabled These Results

**1️⃣ Hybrid AI Strategy**

Combined specialized computer vision (YOLOv8 for defects) with general-purpose AI (GPT-5 for context and reasoning). This achieved 95% accuracy vs. 80% with vision-only approaches. Matching the right AI tool to each task was critical.

**2️⃣ Confidence-Based Escalation**

Every AI decision includes a confidence score. Claims below 70% confidence automatically escalate to human review. This hybrid human-AI workflow maintains quality while maximizing automation—88% of claims fully automated.

**3️⃣ Comprehensive Audit Trails**

Structured JSON logging of every decision, applied rule, and AI analysis. This wasn't just for compliance—it enabled continuous improvement by analyzing which rules and patterns led to appeals, allowing rule refinement over time.

### Lessons for Similar Organizations

**If You're Automating Claims or Document Analysis, Consider This:**

✓ **Start with a focused scope** — We began with 3 common defect types before expanding to 10. This allowed rapid deployment and learning.

✓ **Budget for data preparation** — 40% of project time was cleaning historical claim data for AI training. Quality data = quality AI.

✓ **Build confidence scoring from day 1** — Don't aim for 100% automation. Design for human oversight on edge cases from the start.

✓ **Involve domain experts early** — Claims adjusters tested the system in week 5, catching nuances that would have caused production issues.

✓ **Design for integration** — RESTful API allowed Zaffco to integrate with their existing CRM without replacing systems.
