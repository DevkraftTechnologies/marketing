# ZAFCO AI Warranty Claims Analysis - Case Study

**DevKraft AI-Powered Tire Warranty Processing System**

---

## OVERVIEW

**Industry:** Tire Manufacturing & Warranty Processing
**Challenge:** Manual claims processing taking 48+ hours with 30% inconsistency
**Solution:** AI-powered automation with computer vision and intelligent decision engine
**Results:** 99% faster processing, 82% cost reduction, 44% higher customer satisfaction

### About ZAFCO

ZAFCO operates in the tire warranty claims processing industry, handling warranty claims for multiple tire manufacturers and retail partners. Their traditional process relied on manual inspection by trained adjusters who examined tire images, reviewed warranty documentation, and made subjective decisions on claim validity.

**The Business Challenge:**
As their retail partner network expanded, ZAFCO faced a critical bottleneck. Manual processing with 5-10 adjusters working concurrently could handle only limited daily volume, with each claim taking 48 hours to adjudicate. Decision inconsistency across adjusters led to disputes and appeals, while the inability to scale without proportional staff increases threatened their growth strategy.

**Why They Needed AI:**
ZAFCO required a solution that could maintain quality while dramatically increasing throughput. The system needed to detect tire defects accurately, apply complex manufacturer-specific warranty rules consistently, and provide complete audit trails for compliance—all while processing claims in minutes instead of days.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Key Insights: What Enabled These Results

**1. Hybrid AI Strategy**

Combined specialized computer vision (YOLOv8 for defects) with general-purpose AI (GPT-5 for context and reasoning). This achieved 75% improvement in reassessment rates through consistent, standardized decision-making. Matching the right AI tool to each task was critical.

**2. Confidence-Based Escalation**

Every AI decision includes a confidence score. Claims below 70% confidence automatically escalate to human review. This hybrid human-AI workflow maintains quality while maximizing automation—88% of claims fully automated.

**3. Comprehensive Audit Trails**

Structured JSON logging of every decision, applied rule, and AI analysis. This wasn't just for compliance—it enabled continuous improvement by analyzing which rules and patterns led to appeals, allowing rule refinement over time.

### Lessons for Similar Organizations

**If You're Automating Claims or Document Analysis, Consider This:**

**Start with a focused scope** — We began with 3 common defect types before expanding to 10. This allowed rapid deployment and learning.

**Budget for data preparation** — 40% of project time was cleaning historical claim data for AI training. Quality data = quality AI.

**Build confidence scoring from day 1** — Don't aim for 100% automation. Design for human oversight on edge cases from the start.

**Involve domain experts early** — Claims adjusters tested the system in weeks 9-10, catching nuances that would have caused production issues.

**Design for integration** — RESTful API allowed ZAFCO to integrate with their existing CRM without replacing systems.
