# Case Study: AI-Powered Tire Warranty Claim Automation

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Zaffco (Tire Manufacturing & Distribution)
**Industry:** Automotive / Insurance
**Solution:** Computer Vision + LLM-based Claim Analysis System
**Results:** 85% reduction in claim processing time, 40% cost savings in manual inspection

---

## The Challenge

Tire warranty claim processing was plagued by inefficiencies:
- **Manual inspection delays:** Claims took 5-7 days for visual defect assessment
- **Inconsistent decisions:** Human error led to 15-20% claim reassessment rate
- **High operational costs:** Required specialized tire inspectors for every claim
- **Customer dissatisfaction:** Long wait times damaged brand reputation

Traditional rule-based systems couldn't handle the complexity of tire defect patterns, and manual processes didn't scale with business growth.

## The Solution

Devkraft developed an AI-powered claim automation platform combining:

### Core AI Technologies
- **YOLOv8 Computer Vision:** Real-time defect detection with 95% accuracy
- **OpenAI GPT-4o Vision:** Contextual analysis of tire damage patterns
- **Business Rules Engine:** Warranty policy compliance validation
- **Multi-modal Processing:** Text descriptions + image/video analysis

### Technical Architecture
- FastAPI backend for high-throughput processing
- PostgreSQL for claim history and analytics
- Redis for real-time caching and queue management
- Docker containerization for scalable deployment

### Key Features
1. **Automated Defect Detection:** Identifies manufacturing defects vs. user damage
2. **Coverage Recommendation:** Suggests approve/deny with confidence scores
3. **Compliance Validation:** Ensures decisions align with warranty terms
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete decision transparency for regulatory compliance

## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Data collection & model training
- Collected 10,000+ annotated tire defect images
- Fine-tuned YOLOv8 on tire-specific defect patterns
- Integrated GPT-4o for damage context analysis

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** System integration
- RESTful API development
- Integration with existing claim management system
- User acceptance testing with claim adjusters

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Deployment & optimization
- Staged rollout across 3 regional offices
- Continuous model retraining with feedback loop
- Performance monitoring and optimization
