# Case Study: Enterprise Semantic Search & Knowledge AI

## Executive Summary

**Client:** Global Pharmaceutical Organization (Indegene)
**Industry:** Life Sciences / Knowledge Management
**Solution:** Multi-modal RAG Platform for Enterprise Knowledge
**Results:** 90% faster information retrieval, $5M saved in duplicate work, 40% productivity gain

---

## The Challenge

Enterprise knowledge was trapped in silos, creating massive inefficiencies:
- **Information overload:** 100,000+ documents across multiple systems
- **Poor discoverability:** Employees spent 30% of time searching for information
- **Duplicate work:** Teams unknowingly recreated existing analyses
- **Multi-format chaos:** PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoints, videos, audio files
- **Keyword limitations:** Traditional search missed semantic connections
- **No institutional memory:** Knowledge lost when employees left

Legacy search tools failed to understand context, and employees resorted to asking colleagues instead of finding answers themselves.

---

## The Solution

Devkraft built an enterprise-grade semantic search and RAG platform:

### Core AI Technologies
- **Multi-LLM Support:** OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo), Claude (3.5-sonnet, 3-opus, 3-haiku)
- **Vector Search:** PGVector for semantic similarity
- **Multi-modal Processing:** Text, images, audio, video understanding
- **RAG Architecture:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate answers
- **Research Agents:** Perplexity integration for web research
- **Document Intelligence:** AssemblyAI for audio/video transcription

### Technical Architecture
- FastAPI with async processing for high concurrency
- PostgreSQL with PGVector extension
- AWS S3 for document storage, AWS Bedrock for LLM access
- Celery for background document processing
- Redis for caching and session management
- Keycloak for SSO and access control

### Key Features
1. **Semantic Search:** Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
2. **AI Q&A:** Ask questions, get answers with source citations
3. **Document Chat:** Interactive Q&A with uploaded documents
4. **Report Generation:** Auto-create comprehensive reports from sources
5. **Multi-format Support:** PDF, DOC, PPT, Excel, HTML, audio, video
6. **Web Research:** Combine internal knowledge with live web data
7. **Access Control:** Role-based permissions and data security

## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6):** Data ingestion & processing
- Migrated 100,000+ documents from SharePoint, Google Drive, S3
- Built document processing pipeline for 12+ file formats
- Created vector embeddings for all content (150M+ tokens)

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-10):** RAG system development
- Implemented hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Developed retrieval strategies for different document types
- Built citation and source tracking system

**Phase 3 (Weeks 11-14):** User experience & integration
- Slack integration for in-workflow search
- Web portal with advanced search UI
- API for custom application integration

**Phase 4 (Weeks 15-18):** Scaling & optimization
- Performance tuning for sub-second response times
- Cost optimization through intelligent LLM routing
- Analytics dashboard for usage insights
